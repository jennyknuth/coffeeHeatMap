This is a tutorial for making a heat map graphic with D3.js.

(picture here)

Copy the clone url found at the right -> to your clipboard.
(screen shot here)

In your terminal, type the
```
git clone
```
command followed by the url and the name you want to call the new directory like this:

```
git clone <paste clone url here> <name of new directory here>
```
EXAMPLE:

```
git clone https://gist.github.com/d0d636a3f646a60ba5a3.git myNewDirectoryName
```

To open the file, run a simple server such as http-server or python simple-httpserver. If you have Node installed and the following command doesn't work:
```
http-server -c-1 -o //run http-server with flags -c-1 (disable caching) and -o (automatically open)
```

Follow the directions in the gist found here: [link to how to open a d3 graphic]

first install http server:
```
npm install -g http-server

```
