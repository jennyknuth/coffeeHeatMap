This is a tutorial for making a heat map graphic with D3.js.

(picture here)

First, fork this gist to your own account by clicking the fork symbol in the upper right.
(screen shot here)

Then copy the clone url found at the right to your clipboard.
(screen shot here)

In your terminal, type the
` git clone `
command followed by the url you just copied and the name of your new directory:

```
git clone <paste clone url here> <name of new directory here>
```
EXAMPLE:

```
git clone https://gist.github.com/d0d636a3f646a60ba5a3.git myD3HeatMapExample
```
Move (cd) into your new directory
```
cd myD3HeatMapExample
```
and open the `app.js`, `index.html`, and `style.css` files in your favorite text editor.

To open the D3 file in your browser, you'll need to run a simple server such as `http-server` or `python simple-httpserver`.

If you have Node installed and the following command doesn't work:
```
http-server -c-1 -o //run http-server with flags -c-1 (disable caching) and -o (automatically open)
```
Try this command:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
and then in your browser go to localhost://8000.

If neither of those work, follow the directions for opening a D3 graphic in the gist found here: [link to how to open a D3 graphic]
