cd myD3HeatMapExample
```
then open the `app.js`, `index.html`, and `style.css` files in your favorite text editor.

## How to open a D3 graphic in the browser

To open the D3 file in your browser, you'll need to run a simple server such as `http-server` or `python SimpleHTTPServer` from your new directory.

If you have Node installed try the following command:
```
http-server -c-1 -o
//run http-server with flags -c-1 (disable caching) and -o (automatically open)
```
If that doesn't work, try this command:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
and follow up by going to `localhost://8000` in your browser.

If neither of those work, follow the directions for opening a D3 graphic in the gist found here:
